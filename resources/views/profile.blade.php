<div class="pink">About me</div>
<div class="textborder">My name is Eline Broier. I live in a small village nearby Roosendaal called Wouwse Plantage,
    and I live there with my parents and my younger sister.
    We've always had pets in the past and we still have. Now we have six cats and a dog.
    <br> I went to primary school in Wouw. I didn't like the school so I changed schools in 6th grade.
    I went to another school that was also in Wouw. I had a great time there.
    After that, I went to the secondary school in Roosendaal,
    named Jan Tinbergen College where I did HAVO with the profile Natuur&Techniek.
    <br>
    In the future I would love to travel. I always wanted to visit Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.
    In the summer holidays we often go to Germany and Austria. My family and me like mountain hiking.

<div class="pink">My hobbies are:</div>
<div class="textborder">During my leisure time I like to draw, bake and read books. I don't have a favorite genre,
    but there is one book that is my favorite: The horse whisperer. I think it's a beautiful story.
    I like horse riding, moutain biking. My aunt has her own horse, called Astrid.
    I enjoy going to Astrid with my aunt to go for a outdoor ride.
    After we return from the outdoor ride we go mountain biking trough the forest.
    I also enjoy hiking. We live close to the forest so we do this a lot with my family and with my dog.
    My dog is called Guusje. She is almost eleven months old.
    Guusje and I go to the puppy training every week, we both enjoy the puppy training.
    One of my main hobbies is photography, I mainly photograph flowers.
    I love being outside in the nature. I garden,
    I have my own piece of garden and I have my own kitchen garden on it.
