    <div class="pink">Why HBO</div>
    <div class="textborder">I have visiteds many different kind of schools and study programs.
        At university you get a lot of theory and i would struggle with learning that much theory.
        That's why the HBO level suits me because I am practical and learn better in practice.
        I like that at HBO you work result-oriented.
        The study programme suits my personality because I like to learn new things.
        I am creative and I like to solve problems.
        I also like interaction with other people.
        What appeals to me are the (group)projects you have to do and the feedback you get.
        You can learn a lot from that feedback and benefit from it.
        What I also like about ICT is that technology keeps on developing. So there are lot of challenges.
        There is diversity in ICT jobs.

        Funny detail: my grandfather on my father's side worked in the ICT world.
        My dad worked as director of ICT at the HBO in Rotterdam.
